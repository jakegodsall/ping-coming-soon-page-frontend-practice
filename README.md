## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM
- SASS
- 7-1 SASS Architecture

### What I learned

I have learned a lot during this project, but the most notable things are:

- More DOM manipulation and traversal.
- Creating DOM error messages that respond to user input (i.e. not being showed multiple times when submitting a form)
- Prioritising error messages, for example, showing an error message for when a field is blank, and if not blank, then checking for the correct format using regex.
- How to change the colour of svg files using filter.

### Continued development

I am now going to try working on some Junior frontend mentor projects, as I believe I have made enough progress to move up, and will benefit more from tackling more difficult problems than staying within the comfort of doing what I already know how to do.
